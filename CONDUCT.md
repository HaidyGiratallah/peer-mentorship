The following code of conduct is modified from the [UofT Coders Code of Conduct](https://github.com/UofTCoders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/codeOfConduct.md). 

Like our regular events, all peer mentorship related activities are intended for networking, collaboration, and learning. 
We value the participation of every member of the scientific community and want all participants to have an 
enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all participants, mentors and mentees alike, are expected to 
show respect and courtesy to one another as well as other participants throughout events and online interactions
in the context of our peer mentorship program. 

Organizers will enforce this code throughout events over the course of the semester, but you may also contact us privately; 
all communication will be treated as confidential.

## Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, 
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, choice of operating system, 
or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, 
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, 
stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, 
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Be kind to others. Be aware of your words, and use language that is positive and community-building. 
All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. 
Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may take any 
action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event and/or peer
mentorship program. 

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly program for all.
