## Peer Mentorship Expectations

We expect mentors and mentees to largely set their own terms
with regards to meeting frequency, forms of communication, and so on
based on what works for both parties and their respective needs/schedules.

However, we still expect that:

- Mentors and mentees contact one another and set terms **prior to the first co-working/intro session**.
- Mentors and mentees are both fully aware of and fully agree to the conditions set between them.
- All involved parties involved abide by the [Code of Conduct][conduct], both during UofT Coders events and in their own within-group communications.
